## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Update go version to v1.25.6, with appropriate upgrades to the base docker images, linter, and controller generator. [#1282](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1283) [davidLif](https://github.com/davidLif)

### Fixed
- Race condition where `SyncForGpuGroup` could prematurely delete reservation pods when the informer cache had not yet propagated GPU group labels on recently-bound fraction pods. The binder now checks for active BindRequests referencing the GPU group before deleting a reservation pod.

- Updated resource enumeration logic to exclude resources with count of 0. [#1120](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1120)

## [v0.12.17] - 2026-03-04
