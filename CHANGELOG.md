## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Update go version to v1.25.6, With appropriate upgrades to the base docker images, linter, and controller generator. [#1279](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1279) [davidLif](https://github.com/davidLif)

### Fixed
- Race condition where `SyncForGpuGroup` could prematurely delete reservation pods when the informer cache had not yet propagated GPU group labels on recently-bound fraction pods. The binder now checks for active BindRequests referencing the GPU group before deleting a reservation pod.

- Updated resource enumeration logic to exclude resources with count of 0. [#1120](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/issues/1120)

## [v0.9.15] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- When a status update for a podGroup in the scheduler is flushed due to update conflict, delete the update payload data as well [#691](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/pull/691) [davidLif](https://github.com/davidLif)

## [v0.9.13] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where queue status did not reflect its podgroups resources correctly [#1049](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1049)
- Fixed plugin server (snapshot and job-order endpoints) listening on all interfaces by binding to localhost only.
- Fixed admission webhook to skip runtimeClassName injection when gpuPodRuntimeClassName is empty [#1035](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/pull/1035)

## [v0.9.12] - 2026-01-21
