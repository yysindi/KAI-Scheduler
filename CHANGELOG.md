# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Update go version to v1.25.6, With appropriate upgrades to the base docker images, linter, and controller generator.

### Fixed
- Race condition where `SyncForGpuGroup` could prematurely delete reservation pods when the informer cache had not yet propagated GPU group labels on recently-bound fraction pods. The binder now checks for active BindRequests referencing the GPU group before deleting a reservation pod.
